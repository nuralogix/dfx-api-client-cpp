Cloud Types
===========

Every service has an associated struct type which
is utilized when communicating with the service
end point and defined in the associated header files.

They also contain helper functions for mapping to and
from enumerated types along with ``to_json`` and
``from_json`` functions which makes it easy to serialize.
